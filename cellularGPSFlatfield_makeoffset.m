%% makeoffset
% The offset image is an approximation of the dark field. The dark field
% image is the signal captured by the camera when there is no light on the
% sensor. This function will smooth the image captured with a zero
% exposure.

%%% Input:
% * chan: the name of the channel to have an offset image created.
% * ffpath: the location of the correction images

%%% Output:
% An offset image is created and written to the directory that contains the
% flat field images.

%% smooth the image
% Images from the lab typically end up being 1344 x 1024 or 672 x 512,
% depending on whether or not there is binning. The size of the image will
% influence the size of the filters used to smooth the image.
